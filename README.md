# chatapp
=======
Chat room using ExpressJS and Socket.io

The app has 3 parts namely chatroom, photos and settings.

Chatroom: multiple number of users can connect to this chatroom, they can send messages which are displayed with their respective usernames. 

Photos: This section has a carousel slider of 10 photos taken from Lorempixel. You can go over the slider either by clicking next prev arrows or by sliding over if you are on mobile.

Settings: There are 2 options in settings, you can change your username and continue chatting in the chatroom. You can also change the height and width of the slider for which I have used jQuery UI step slider for ease of usability.

The Working code is live another repo <a href="https://github.com/anshul119/chatapp-source">here</a> and I have deployed the app on Heroku using the same code whcih you may check <a href="http://doclerchat.herokuapp.com">here</a>.
